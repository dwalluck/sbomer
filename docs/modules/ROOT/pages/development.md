# Development

The fastest way to start with SBOMer development is to set up the [development environment](environments.md).

### JDK 17

This project is developed using JDK 17. Not that any features require it, but why not?

You can use https://sdkman.io/ to install and manage JDKs:

```
sdk install java 17.0.6-tem
```

When you enter the project directory you can run:

```
sdk env
```

And you're all set!

> You can add `$HOME/.sdkman/etc/config` following entry:
>
> ```
> sdkman_auto_env=true
> ```
>
> And have the JDK set automatically when entering the directory.

## Preparing Minikube

```
./hack/minikube-setup.sh
```

## Preparing required secret

We need two create a pull secret to be able to pull images from Red Hat registry: `sbomer-redhatio-pull-secret`

### Image registry pull secret

We use image(s) from Red Hat Container Registry. You can authenticate with the registry.redhat.io registry by
[generating a token on this page](https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/#/).

Once you generate the token, download the secret. Ensure that the name of the resource is `sbomer-redhatio-pull-secret`.
It should look similar to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sbomer-redhatio-pull-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: "sbomer"
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: AWESOMEBASE64CONTENT===
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Then apply it.

## Deploying Tekton

Tekton deployment should be handled externally to the application deployment. This can be achieved by installing a
particular Tekton release. To be as close as possible to the staging and production deployment we should use
similar version of Tekton for development as deployed on the target environments.

```
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.41.3/release.yaml
```

## Installing SBOMer using Helm

```
helm upgrade --install sbomer ./helm
```

## Exposing the database

The database is run in the Kubernetes cluster, but our service is outside of it.
To make the service work we need to expose the database.

```
./hack/minikube-expose-db.sh
```

## Running service in development mode

To run the service you just need to run Quarkus in the development mode:

```
./hack/run-service-dev.sh
```

The service will be available at: http://localhost:8080.

## Mounting SBOM dir

```
minikube -p sbomer mount `pwd`:/tmp/something --uid=65532
```

If you have troubles mounting the directory, it may be related for firewall, try this:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=libvirt --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.39.0/24" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Tests

```
./hack/run-maven.sh clean verify
```

## Building images

All images used by this service can be found in the `src/main/images` directory.

> :warning: Context path
>
> Please note that in order to build images, the context needs to be set to the **root of the repository**.

There are available scripts that help with building all images:

- `hack/build-images-podman.sh`

  Uses local Podman to build all images.

- `hack/build-images-docker.sh`

  Uses local Docker to build all images.

- `hack/build-images-minikube.sh`

  Build images inside of the Minikube environment. This is very useful in case of the `local` development environment
  where you want to test images in a full Kubernetes deployment.

> :arrow_right: Service needs to be built first!
>
> If you don't use above scripts -- please make sure you build the project before building images to ensure the latest
> state of the service is included in the image.

## Starting from scratch

You can always start from scratch, just run these commands:

```
./hack/minikube-delete.sh
./hack/minikube-setup.sh
```
